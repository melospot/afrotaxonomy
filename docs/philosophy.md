# Taxonomy Philosophy

## Core principles
- Use stable IDs to avoid renaming churn.
- Keep hierarchy explicit through `parents`.
- Separate hierarchy from discovery tags.
- Prefer small, composable files over large monolithic datasets.

## Editorial approach
- Describe genres neutrally and briefly.
- Use aliases for common alternate spellings or labels.
- Mark uncertain or emerging styles as `experimental` where needed.
