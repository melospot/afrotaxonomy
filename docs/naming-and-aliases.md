# Naming And Aliases

## IDs
- Use `snake_case` IDs.
- IDs should be stable and never reused.

## Display names
- `name` should use common community-facing labeling where possible.
- Avoid adding marketing phrases in the name field.

## Aliases
- Put alternate spellings, punctuation variants, and scene shorthand in `aliases`.
- Keep aliases concise and deduplicated.
