# Disputes And Contested Classifications

Genre labels can be contested across regions, generations, and scenes.

## Policy
- Record the most broadly used label in `name`.
- Keep alternatives in `aliases`.
- Use `references` to document competing or evolving viewpoints.
- Avoid prescriptive language that delegitimizes local usage.

## Editorial notes
- When disagreements are unresolved, keep `description` neutral.
- Prefer documented evidence over preference.
