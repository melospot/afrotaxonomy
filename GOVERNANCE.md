# Governance

## Maintainers
Maintainers steward taxonomy quality, schema changes, and dispute resolution.

## Decision policy
- Routine data updates: maintainer review + merge.
- Schema or policy changes: at least two maintainer approvals.
- Disputed classifications: keep neutral wording and require references.

## Versioning
- Tag data and schema updates in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Use semantic versioning for schema-affecting changes.
